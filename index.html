			<h2>WORK HISTORY</h2>
			<h3>Accenture</h3>
			<h4>International Media Client; July 2014 - Present</h4>
			<p>
				I spent two years working for an <span class="key">international media client</span> that was expanding their web presence
				and their ability to offer <span class="key">streaming video</span>. I started with a mix of front and back end technologies,
				progressing to become a <span class="key">front-end team lead</span> with four developers reporting to me.<br> I worked
				on an <span class="key">asynchronous batch ingest</span> service for video ingestion for the flagship US site and complimentary
				app using <span class="key">HHVM/Hack</span> and
				<span class="key">Laravel</span>. I designed, prototyped and built photo and <span class="key">video editing tools</span>,
				using <span class="key">HTML5</span> and <span class="key">JavaScript</span>, for producers that synchronised with the
				batch service. Allowing them to edit videos quickly and easily.<br> I worked as front-end lead of a team who oversee
				and develop <span class="key">new features</span> for over <span class="key">40 sites and services</span>. We created
				unique systems for analysis and adding value to the business using <span class="key">angular.js</span> and released and
				<span class="key">rebranded</span> sites in <span class="key">rapid</span> succession. I am used to working in an
				<span
					class="key">agile</span> environment, using <span class="key">Jira</span> and leading <span class="key">scrums</span>. I worked daily
					with teams spread <span class="key">around the world</span> in over 10 different locations and have developed the time
					management skills required to work effectively across multiple time zones.

			<h3>Buddi</h3>
			<h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER; JAN 2014 - MAY 2014</h4>
			<p>
				Buddi have a broad range of technologies that it uses for its electronic monitoring equipment. My work involved helping to
				<span class="key">develop new platforms</span>, <span class="key">adding functionality</span> to existing platforms,
				<span class="key">improving response times</span> and functionality to the
				<span class="key">API</span>. I spent equal amounts of time working with both <span class="key">client-side</span> and
				<span class="key">server-side</span> technologies. Front-end technologies included <span class="key">ExtJS</span>,
				<span
					class="key">JQuery</span> and <span class="key">CSS</span>, the back-end a <span class="key">real-time data</span> server running
					<span class="key">node.js</span> and a web portal running using <span class="key">PHP</span> with a custom framework.
			</p>
			<h3>The Federation Against Copyright Theft</h3>
			<h4>SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER; JULY 2013 - DEC 2013</h4>
			<p>I aided in the development of tools & <span class="key">crawlers</span> which are used to automate anti-piracy tasks and
				provide time saving tools for the internet investigation team. The projects utilise <span class="key">complex crawler technologies</span>				and <span class="key">sophisticated pattern matching</span> to gather information from the web.<br> The program I worked
				on aided the <span class="key">investigation</span> of copyright infringement by analysing large quantities of data quickly
				and automatically. This helped detect <span class="key">trademark violation</span>, <span class="key">copyright infringement</span>,
				and <span class="key">brand hijacking</span> using innovative pattern matching techniques.</p>
			<h3>AlTim Software</h3>
			<h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER; NOV 2009 - JULY 2013</h4>
			<p>
				My main role was as a developer. I created a <span class="key">database</span> and an accompanying website for the company's
				intranet using <span class="key">Python/Django</span>,
				<span class="key">PostgreSQL</span> and <span class="key">MooTools</span>. This allowed the company to understand the
				data generated by their business and efficiently manage it.
			</p>
			<h3>Toxic Games</h3>
			<h4>QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTER; WORK EXPERIENCE</h4>
			<p>
				I was one of a team of <span class="key">functional testers</span> (gameplay) working for Toxic on their first game
				<span
					class="key">Q.U.B.E.</span> I was tasked with submitting
					<span class="key">bug reports</span> and testing various sections of the game for bugs and fixing them as I found them,
					as well as suggesting
					<span class="key">improvements</span> for how the game felt and played.
			</p>
			<h3>E.C. Harris</h3>

				clients</span> and <span class="key">designing and drawing blueprints</span>.</p>
			<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
			<p>
				I enjoy sports including <span class="key">football</span>, <span class="key">rugby</span>, <span class="key">sailing</span>,
				and <span class="key">rowing</span>. I am a big reader, these days mostly stuffy <span class="key">economics</span> or
				philosophy textbooks mixed in with the occasional <span class="key">sci-fi</span> thriller. I am a huge <span class="key">music fan</span>				and a bit of a <span class="key">film buff</span>. In my spare time I can usually be found sat in a <span class="key">hipster coffee</span>				shop with my <span class="key">AlienWare laptop</span>, writing applications in whatever <span class="key">langue
				du jour</span> has taken my fancy. I also enjoy <span class="key">skiing</span>, <span class="key">traveling</span>,
				<span class="key">languages</span> - speaking badly and learning, <span class="key">video games</span>, <span class="key">cooking</span>,
				and making <span class="key">cocktails</span>.
